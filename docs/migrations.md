# Data migrations and upgrade compatibility

## Upgrade contract

Application upgrades preserve saved decisions, IDs, histories, assessments, command
output and delivery evidence. Compatible format or workflow changes must not require
resetting data or repeating model calls. Genuinely changed decisions, code snapshots,
models or assessment semantics still require fresh evidence. A migration never
creates missing provenance or certifies that old verification commands ran again.

Assess migration impact for every persisted-data change, including fingerprints and
freshness rules. Record the plan here **with the code change**, before release:

1. Source and target formats, affected records and the reason for the change.
2. Exact transformations and the evidence establishing compatibility. Distinguish
   compatible representation changes from semantic changes requiring reassessment.
3. Preservation of original evidence, IDs, timestamps and history; backup strategy.
4. Transaction/retry behavior, concurrency and active-worker handling, unsupported
   future formats and recovery after failure.
5. Upgrade fixtures/checks actually run and remaining qualification gaps.

## Version boundaries

- SQLite `PRAGMA user_version`: database schema, currently **2**.
- Execution payload `schemaVersion`: JSON representation, currently **1**. Missing
  means the shipped legacy format, **0**.
- Execution `version`: optimistic-concurrency counter, independent of schema version.
- Assessment `compatibility`: evidence/acceptance semantics, currently
  `assessment-evidence-v1`. Change it only when prior findings are semantically
  incompatible, or add an explicit reviewed compatibility migration.
- Decision identity `decisions-v1`: relevant saved requirement/decision inputs.
  Object keys are canonicalized; array order is preserved and path sets are sorted.
  Prompt instruction prose (`evidencePolicy`), the skill document and context-budget
  policy are excluded. Required decisions and acceptance scenarios remain included.
  Changes to the input projection itself still need a compatibility review/migration.

Skills and context policies remain recorded as original provenance and govern new
requests. A compatible assessment is not invalidated solely by those labels changing.
Its actual model, requirement, relevant decisions and latest captured code must still
match. Delivery decision identity is independent of assessment workflow prose.

## Implemented migration ledger

### Database 0/1 → 2; execution payload 0 → 1 (2026-10-19)

Implementation: `src/storage/migrations.ts`, called by `ProjectStore` before workspace
upgrades/publication. The base tables are initialized first for a new database.
An ordered registry applies migrations under one immediate SQLite transaction and
records each version/name/time in `migration_history`.

Transforms:

- Add explicit execution schema version, keeping all existing execution fields.
- Convert known legacy `[taskInputs, referencedPaths, fullSkillDocument]` identities
  to `decisions-v1`, using the **saved inputs**, never today's project state. This also
  normalizes legacy object-property ordering without reinterpreting decisions.
- Recognize the exact shipped assessment v1 document using its frozen SHA-256 digest.
  Only results also recording policy `requirement-isolation-v3` and the correct skill
  name/version receive `assessment-evidence-v1` compatibility metadata. Unknown
  documents/workflows and missing identities are retained without inventing metadata.
- Apply identity conversion to aggregate, workspace and main assessments, current
  delivery and delivery history. Save the original identity in
  `legacyContextFingerprint`. Retain original model/skill/policy, evidence, source
  hashes, dates, check output, current/archived coding runs and assessment runs.
- Keep an exact original execution payload and its concurrency version in
  `execution_migration_backups`, keyed by project and migration. These are local
  SQLite payload backups, not standalone full-database backups or portable exports.
- Advance each migrated execution row's concurrency counter once, so an already-open
  client cannot overwrite its new representation. Specification revisions do not change.
- Mark connected workspace artifacts dirty for normal conflict-aware publication.
  Portable artifact format stays at 2; local identities/backups are not exported.

Compatibility and reuse:

- Known equivalent legacy results keep current credit if their actual inputs still
  match. A changed human decision remains stale after migration.
- Older pre-skill policies, unknown skill documents and context projections not
  demonstrably equivalent are **not** automatically certified compatible. Dated
  results remain available. Legacy results without context identity retain their
  prior revision-bound freshness behavior but are not reusable inference checkpoints.
- Main verification commands still run on an explicit main check; an upgrade itself
  does not run commands, infer, fetch Git or resume a worker.

Failure/recovery:

- Live execution leases block the upgrade. Stop the owning worker and reopen; expired
  leases do not block it and are not otherwise modified by migration.
- Invalid JSON, unsupported future payloads or inconsistent row/payload concurrency
  versions stop the transaction. Payload edits, backup rows, migration history and
  database version roll back together. Reopening retries the upgrade safely.
- Repeated startup validates supported payload formats without reapplying migrations,
  duplicating backups or changing counters. Older app builds reject database version 2.
- On failure, keep the database and its WAL/SHM companions intact. Correct the reported
  blocker and retry. Original-payload backups support diagnosis/manual repair; there
  is no automatic downgrade or restore command. Copying only `projects.sqlite` while
  an app is writing is not a consistent external backup procedure.

Verification (2026-10-19): type checking, all 220 deterministic tests, the UI build
and Playwright browser checks passed. Desktop TypeScript compilation also passed.
After freezing the legacy skill test fixture independently of the current workflow,
the four migration tests and the real-local-Git incremental-check/upgrade test passed
again. Tests cover preserved evidence/main credit, repeated startup, stale CAS rejection,
changed decisions remaining stale, unknown/missing provenance, transactional rollback,
live-lease blocking/retry, malformed/future payload rejection and unknown-result reuse
without inference. Installer upgrade behavior and the user's particular saved data
have not been exercised by the deterministic fixtures. No live model calls were made.

## Existing migrations and follow-ups

The workspace artifact 1 → 2 conversion retains its existing publication journal and
external-edit checks; see [project-workspaces.md](project-workspaces.md). Older project
snapshots still use the existing schema-default/read normalization. Provider/settings
migrations retain their existing boundaries. This change does not claim those earlier
paths were retrofitted into the new execution migration registry.

Future database migrations append registry entries. Future execution representations
must add ordered transformations and increment their schema version; do not reinterpret
the CAS counter. Add curated old-data fixtures for each supported upgrade path.
